"The objective is to update the NVD product on a regular basis as soon as "
"mechanisms have been established between NRN partners. One of the update "
"mechanisms is by establishing change management principles. The "
"establishment of change management principles is founded on two basic "
"concepts: identification rules and definition / classification of change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../nvd_identification_rules.rst:52
msgid ""
"The concept of Identification is based on objects that depict real-world "
"phenomena that vary over time, either by their description, by their "
"precision or by the instruments and methods involved in their initial "
"acquisition. It is therefore possible that more than one representation "
"of the same phenomena may exist. To illustrate this fact, as part of this"
" initiative, the goal is to build and maintain a **single** "
"representation of the National Road Network. Identifiers play a "
"fundamental role in ensuring long-term distributed data management and "
"for implementing update mechanisms of Objects modified at the source and "
"already provided to users. The implementation of a standard for the "
"permanent identification of a phenomenon and its application must achieve"
" two primary objectives:"

"Every occurrence of NVD basic features must be uniquely identified: As an"
" example, each geometric object in the NRN: *Road Element*, *Ferry "
"Connection*, and *Junction* that describe specific characteristics of the"
" linear network must also be uniquely identified."

"The Identifiers must be permanently assigned or persistent. To ensure "
"their stability, the assigned IDs must be insignificant (inconsequential)"
" in their expression [#f1]_. In other words, the IDs must not contain any"
" information relative to the data. Past experience has demonstrated that "
"encapsulating information within the ID can cause ID modification without"
" any real change ever having occurred in the data."

"Several standards have dealt with the Road Network. Most of them point to"
" the importance of using Identifiers without ever specifying the manner, "
"format, or method of application. GDF [#f2]_, GIS-T (GIS in "
"transportation data standards) [#f3]_ and CEN TC 278 [#f4]_ documentation"
" have no specifications related to Identifiers. National Spatial Data "
"Infrastructure – USA (NSDI) Framework Transportation Identification "
"Standard was the only document that clearly defined and described an "
"Identifier code [#f5]_. However, within the ISO TC 211/SC: Geographic "
"Information Standard - Encoding [#f6]_ the UUID definition did comply to "

"“An application domain defines a universe and an identification scheme "
"called universal unique identifiers (UUIDs). A UUID is assigned to an "
"object when it is created and is stable over the object's entire life "
"span. The UUID of a deleted object cannot be used again. UUIDs are "
"required for long-term distributed data management and for implementing "
"update mechanisms. These identifiers are also called persistent "
"identifiers. A special name server may be used to resolve persistent "
"identifiers. The identifiers are unique within a well-defined limited "
"universe defined by an application domain.”"

"A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with "
"respect to the space of all UUIDs. UUID generation does not require a "
"registration authority for each single identifier. Instead, it requires a"
" unique value over space for each UUID generator. This spatially unique "
"value is specified as an IEEE 802 address, which is usually already "
"applied to network-connected systems. This 48-bit address can be assigned"
" based on an address block obtained through the IEEE registration "
"authority. This UUID specification assumes the availability of an IEEE "
"802 address."

"representation (32 characters) is specified as a sequence of fields. The "
