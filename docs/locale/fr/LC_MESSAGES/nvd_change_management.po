"The objective is to update the NVD data on a regular basis as soon as "
"mechanisms have been established between NVD’s partners. One of the "
"mechanisms is establishing change management principles. Two basic "
"concepts are needed: identification rules and definition / classification"
" of change."

":doc:`nvd_identification_rules` defines the identification mechanism used"
" as precisely as possible. In terms of change management, the NVD doesn't"
" attempt to track the evolution of phenomena in the real world "
"(features), but rather of the objects that represent them. In other "
"words, the NVD does not monitor real changes in the territory; they "

"It is aimed to monitor the evolution of objects in order to identify any "
"changes that may have occurred between two observations, whether "

"are referred to as the differential [#f5]_. Change management also makes "
"it possible to track updates as well as data corrections. The purpose of "

"or descriptive modification or confirmation of the preceding state can "
"occur, while maintaining the same NID. Data with the effects "
"\"addition,\" \"geometric or descriptive modification,\" and "
